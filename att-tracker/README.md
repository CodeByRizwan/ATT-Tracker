# Attendance Tracker

This project is a web application built using **Next.js** for both the frontend and backend, **MongoDB** as the database, and **NextAuth.js** for authentication. It allows users to track their attendance, categorize attendance as "full", "half", or "absent", and view a calendar of their attendance records.
